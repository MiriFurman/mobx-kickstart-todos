MobX Todo List Console App
---------------------------
  
  Create a todo list that implements the following behavior:
  - Add todo
  - Remove todo
  - Toggle todo's completed state
  - Toggle all todos completed state
  - Get the total number of todos
  - Get the number of completed todos

  The app has no UI. Instead, we will use the console
  to show the state of the app.
  The console UI's behavior should be:
  - Print all the todos in the list, as well as the total number of todos and number of completed todos.
  - The console should reflect changes in the app's state.
  - Only relevant changes should be printed.
